Measured diagonally, Galaxy Z Fold5’s size is 7.6" in the full rectangle and 7.4" accounting for the rounded corners; actual viewable area is less due to the rounded corners. Based on Samsung internal lab test conditions with pre-release version of given model connected to earphone via Bluetooth under default settings over LTE. Estimated against battery capacity and measured current over battery power consumption during video playback (video file resolution 720p, saved on device) and audio playback (mp3 file, 192kbps, saved on device with LCD display turned off), respectively. Actual video and audio playback times vary by network connection, settings, file format, screen brightness, battery condition and many other factors.
